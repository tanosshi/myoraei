## How Kanade Stands Out from Other Music Players

- Everything is customizable, from every aspect of the app including the app logo. If you do not want something, toggle it off.
- Run fully offline, hybrid synced or fully online. It all depends on your likings.
- Offline music recommendation, based off of your listening habits.
- yt-dlp fully integrated, always with fallback support.
- Last.fm integration, your stats are always yours.
- Locally track listening habits, only for you, fully private.
- Automatically fetch album covers and lyrics if toggled.
- All your data is yours, stored locally on your device or optionally synced.
- Open source and always will be.
- Plenty of pre-made themes.
- All user ideas are valued to me.

## How Other Music Players Compare

- Most players are built in Kotlin, while we run in Expo.js. Performance may vary.
- Battery usage might be slightly higher than the average music player.
- For low end devices the app may lag a bit during startup or caching.
